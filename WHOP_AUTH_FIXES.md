# Whop Authentication Fixes Applied

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Inconsistent Redirect URIs** ❌➡️✅
**Problem**: The OAuth initialization and callback were using different redirect URIs between local development and production, causing token exchange failures.

**Fix**: 
- Updated both `api/oauth-init.ts` and `api/oauth-callback.ts` to consistently use `https://json-to-video.vercel.app/api/oauth-callback` as the redirect URI
- This ensures the redirect URI used during OAuth initiation matches exactly with the one used during token exchange

### 2. **Improved Membership Verification** ❌➡️✅
**Problem**: The membership checking logic was using direct API calls which were unreliable and not properly filtering for valid membership statuses.

**Fix**:
- Updated `api/oauth-callback.ts` to use the Whop SDK for membership checking instead of direct API calls
- Added proper status validation to include `['active', 'trialing', 'past_due']` statuses as valid
- Added fallback to direct API calls if SDK fails
- Enhanced logging to help debug membership verification

### 3. **Frontend Authentication Flow** ❌➡️✅
**Problem**: The frontend OAuth callback component was expecting different URL parameters than what the backend was providing.

**Fix**:
- Updated `src/pages/OAuthCallback.tsx` to handle the correct URL parameters (`auth=success`, `user_id`, `has_access`)
- Modified navigation logic to redirect users to `/home` if they don't have access (for subscription) vs `/generator` if they do have access

### 4. **WhopContext Session Management** ❌➡️✅
**Problem**: The WhopContext was clearing valid sessions when users didn't have active subscriptions, preventing proper authentication state.

**Fix**:
- Updated `src/contexts/WhopContext.tsx` to distinguish between invalid sessions and valid sessions without subscriptions
- Added support for multiple cookie formats for compatibility
- Enhanced session clearing to remove all possible authentication cookies
- Users now stay authenticated even without active subscriptions, allowing them to purchase

### 5. **Enhanced Error Handling and Logging** ➕
**Added**:
- Comprehensive logging throughout the authentication flow
- Better error messages and debugging information
- Fallback mechanisms for API calls

## Environment Variables Verified ✅

All the provided credentials are correctly set in `.env`:
- `WHOP_API_KEY=vtecLpF8ydpmxsbl3fir5ZhjQiOYYqYnX6Xh2dWZzws`
- `VITE_PUBLIC_WHOP_APP_ID=app_z0Hznij7sCMJGz`
- `VITE_PUBLIC_WHOP_AGENT_USER_ID=user_39Tw9eHNffVCQ`
- `VITE_PUBLIC_WHOP_COMPANY_ID=biz_WiywYqtLmH0iD6`
- `WHOP_ACCESS_PASS_ID=prod_iZZC4IzX2mi7v`
- `VITE_WHOP_MONTHLY_PLAN_ID=plan_0DGjXrTvavvWm`

## Expected Flow After Fixes

1. **User subscribes** → Whop checkout completes → User gets redirected to OAuth flow
2. **OAuth initiation** → Uses consistent redirect URI
3. **OAuth callback** → Token exchange succeeds → Membership verification works correctly
4. **Frontend processing** → Receives correct parameters → Sets proper authentication state
5. **Navigation** → User with access goes to `/generator`, user without access goes to `/home`

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Clear all cookies** before testing
2. **Test the subscription flow**: Subscribe → Sign in → Should show `access=true`
3. **Test without subscription**: Sign in without subscription → Should stay authenticated but with `access=false`
4. **Check browser console** for detailed logging information during authentication

The fixes ensure that after a user subscribes and signs in through Whop, they will correctly receive `access=true` and be navigated to the appropriate page.
